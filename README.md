Does Defense Win Championships?
An exploratory analysis into whether defense or offense had a bigger impact on winning teams in the NBA, from the NBA/ABA merger onwards.

Data Acquisition
All data was downloaded from the basketball-reference website: https://www.basketball-reference.com/. The datasets downloaded were the Team Per 100 Possessions Stats dataset, the Opponent Per 100 Possessions Stats dataset, and the NBA & ABA Playoff Champions and Top Performers dataset. For the Per 100 Possesions datasets (both Team and Opponent), there was one dataset for each year from the 1976-1977 season (the first season after the NBA/ABA merger) to the 2019-2020 season.
