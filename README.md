An exploratory analysis into whether defense or offense had a bigger impact on winning teams in the NBA, from the introduction of the 3-point shot onwards.

Data Acquisition

All data was downloaded from the basketball-reference website: https://www.basketball-reference.com/. The datasets downloaded were the Team Per 100 Possessions Stats dataset, the Opponent Per 100 Possessions Stats dataset, and the NBA & ABA Playoff Champions and Top Performers dataset. For the Per 100 Possessions datasets (both Team and Opponent), there was one dataset for each year from the 1979-1980 season (the first season where the 3-point shot was introduced) to the 2019-2020 season.
